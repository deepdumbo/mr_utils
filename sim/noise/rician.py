def rician(M,A,sigma):
    '''Generates rician distribution of pixel intensity M.

    Generates the noise distribution of a magnitude MR image.

    M -- measured image pixel intensity
    A -- image pixel intensity in the absence of noise
    sigma -- standard deviation of the Gaussian noise in the real and the
             imaginary images (which we assume to be equal)

    Computes Equation [1] from:
    Gudbjartsson, HÃ¡kon, and Samuel Patz. "The Rician distribution of noisy MRI
        data." Magnetic resonance in medicine 34.6 (1995): 910-914.
